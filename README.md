# Predicting-Bulldozer-Auction-Prices-Using-Machine-Learning
Day 3: Another practice M.L project  i worked on
This  project is aimed at predicting the auction sale prices for heavy equipment, specifically bulldozers. This project utilizes the "Blue Book for Bulldozers" dataset from Kaggle. For this task, I've implemented a RandomForestRegressor model and optimized it using RandomizedSearchCV to ensure the best performance.

This is my third day diving into machine learning projects and sharing them on GitHub. While I've encountered a few challenges, I'm continually learning and improving my skills. Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
